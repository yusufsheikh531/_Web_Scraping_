Web scraping is a way to automate the volume and variety of data collected from the web.
<br>

<h1>What is web scraping?</h1>
<br>
<p>If you’ve ever copy and pasted information from a website, you’ve performed the same function as any web scraper, only on a microscopic, manual scale.</p>
<br>
<p>Web scraping, also known as web data extraction, is the process of retrieving or “scraping” data from a website. Unlike the mundane, mind-numbing process of manually extracting data, web scraping uses intelligent automation to retrieve hundreds, millions, or even billions of data points from the internet’s seemingly endless frontier.</p>
<br>
<p>More than a modern convenience, the true power of web scraping lies in its ability to build and power some of the world’s most revolutionary business applications. ‘Transformative’ doesn’t even begin to describe the way some companies use web scraped data to enhance their operations, informing executive decisions all the way down to individual customer service experiences.</p> 
<br>
<br>


<h1>The basics of web scraping</h1>
<p>It’s extremely simple, in truth, and works by way of two parts: a web crawler and a web scraper. The web crawler is the horse, and the scraper is the chariot. The crawler leads the scraper, as if by the hand, through the internet, where it extracts the data requested.</p>
<br>
<h3>The crawler</h3>
<p>A web crawler, which we generally call a “spider,” is an artificial intelligence that browses the internet to index and search for content by following links and exploring, like a person with too much time on their hands.</p>
<br>
<h3>The scraper</h3>
<p>A web scraper is a specialized tool designed to accurately and quickly extract data from a web page. Web scrapers vary widely in design and complexity, depending on the project.</p>
  <br>
  <br>

<h1>The web scraping process: 3 simple steps</h1>
<br>
<ol>
 <li>First, our team of seasoned scraping veterans develops a scraper unique to your project, designed specifically to target and extract the data you want from the websites you want it from. </li>
<br>
 <li>The data is retrieved in HTML format, after which it is carefully parsed to extricate the raw data you want from the noise surrounding it. Depending on the project, the data can be as simple as a name and address in some cases, and as complex as high dimensional weather and seed germination data the next.</li>
<br>
 <li> Ultimately, the data is stored in the format and to the exact specifications of the project. Some companies use third party applications or databases to view and manipulate the data to their choosing, while others prefer it in a simple, raw format - generally as CSV, TSV or JSON.
Ultimately, the flexibility and scalability of web scraping ensures your project parameters, no matter how specific, can be met with ease. Fashion retailers inform their designers with upcoming trends based on web scraped insights, investors time their stock positions, and marketing teams overwhelm the competition with deep insights, all thanks to the burgeoning adoption of web scraping as an intrinsic part of everyday business.</li>
